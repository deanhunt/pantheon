                        <p>Pantheon is a browser plugin that explores the notion of backdoor access. With the plugin installed, you can take over another person's online identity (provided that person also has the plugin). </p>
                        <p>This is how it works:  Every time you open a new tab in Chrome it opens as if you were a random person who happens to have downloaded the plugin. If they were most recently in Gmail or Facebook, you'll be in Gmail or Facebook just like them, and will be able to take any action they could have taken. We wanted the encounter to be brief, so the borrowed tab quickly begins to decay and is fully dissolved after ten seconds.</p>
                        <p>Pantheon exploits an often forgotten flaw in the infrastructure of the Internet, one of the flaws that the NSA may have also compromised. Online identity is fragilely constructed on top of a set of keys (cookies) that are stored on your device. Pantheon sends these keys along with the tab you’re visiting.  This is opt-in, mutual surveillance: symmetrical and egalitarian. It also leaves no trace. There is no way anyone will know who has taken over whose identity. </p>
                        <p>Using Pantheon is both fun and creepy. It explores the continuum of fear and delight that arises from unexpected intimacy when impersonating someone: do people abuse their newfound power or does it evolve into play? Get the plugin and code from github.com/deanhunt/pantheon. </p>
